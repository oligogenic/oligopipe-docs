## How to edit and build

```
pip install mkdocs
```
* use `mkdocs serve` to dynamically build the pages on localhost while editing the markdown files

* run `mkdocs gh-deploy`: builds the html and pushes to branch `gh-pages` (which is the one being served)

* commit and push the changes to the markdown files to branch `main`
