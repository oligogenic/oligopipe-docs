General FAQ # Can I include variants from multiple patients in my input? No , the analysis should be restricted to a single individual only , as oligopipe creates all possible variant combinations from your variant list assuming that they belong to the same person. If you want to analyse multiple patients, you should separate their variants in different files and explore them individually. Is there a specific input format for the insertions and deletions? oligopipe accepts different types of variant format for the insertions and deletions, involving dashes or not. You can consult the Variant Types section for a detailed explanation. What types of digenic combinations does oligopipe create? oligopipe creates all possible di-allelic, tri-allelic and tetra-llelic variant combinations between any gene pair present in your data, including heterozygous compound variants in one of the two genes. Tetra-llelic combinations with four heterozygous variants (two in each gene) are not created, as these combinations were absent from our training set. For a detailed explanation, you can consult the Creating digenic combinations section. Not all of the expected output files are generated, since no variant combinations are left after preprocessing. What should I do? You can check the following steps to explore possible solutions: Check whether the selected genome version is correct. oligopipe can annotate variants using the GRCh37/hg19 or GRCh38/hg38 genome version , see the Genome version section for more details. Try to relax your variant or gene filtering options, especially the option for keeping intronic and synonymous variants. Ensure that you have more than one gene present in your data. oligopipe makes variant combinations between gene pairs , so it requires the presence of at least two different genes in your data. If you have submitted a small number of variants, these variants may have been excluded from the analysis during the annotation process. For example, the CADD score for those variants may be missing, and as this score is important for the predictions, variants without an annotated CADD score are excluded from the analysis. A detailed list of all possible cases where your variants may be excluded is presented in the Variant Exclusion section. If you have checked the previous steps and you still experience issues, you can send us an email . SOME variants of my initial submission are missing from the results Please check the variant and/or gene filtering options you have selected during your submission, as these play an important role on the absence of some of your variants in the analysis. The variant filtering options offered by oligopipe are automatically pre-selected during the submission, unless you unselect them. Make sure that the variant information and format you provided is correct for all variants. In case you copy-pasted a variant list using the box panel, make sure that the zygosity values are not misspelled ( Heterozygous or Homozygous zygosity values are accepted), see also the tab-delimited variant list section.

For more information regarding our filtering options and the data annotation process, you can consult the Data Filtering and Annotation section. I am pretty sure that a variant is supposed to be mapped to a specific gene (according to my knowledge or the gene panel I provided), but I see another gene name instead in the results. This can happen for the following reasons: The gene symbol present at the gene panel file is not the official HGNC gene symbol. During annotation we only use the official HGNC gene symbols, and thus, we will display this symbol instead of the one that you provided. The position of the variant for that gene overlaps with other genes. In this tricky situation, we have to choose one gene to continue with predictions. We have developed a set of priority rules for that (see the Gene annotation section). Therefore, there is a chance that we have assigned this variant to another gene instead. Unfortunately, it is not possible to re-assign it to your favourite gene manually and we can potentially do changes in our database for that only during major oligopipe updates.

This procedure is highly recommended, as it will limit the amount of variant combinations to be tested and will restrict the analysis to the most relevant variants. There are two types of filtering offered by oligopipe : a variant filtering and a gene filtering procedure. 1. Variant filtering # The variant filtering procedure ensures that your analysis will contain variants in accordance with the variant types used to train the predictive methods ( VarCoPP and HOP ) integrated in oligopipe : exonic and splicing variants of MAF lower or equal than 3.5% in protein-coding genes. The three different filtering options are already pre-selected in the Variant Filtering panel of the submission page. You can unselect a filtering option, by clicking on its corresponding check-box. MAF # Select the minimum threshold of MAF for the variants. A MAF of \u2264 0.035 was used to train VarCoPP and is the recommended threshold. Remove Intergenic # Removes variants that are not inside the defined gene coordinates, based on the selected assembly (GRCh37/hg19 or GRCh38/hg38). Remove intronic and synonymous # Removes: all intronic variants that have a distance bigger than 13 nucleotides from each exon edge, based on the exon coordinates of the canonical transcript of the gene. all synonymous variants that have a distance bigger than 195 nucleotides from each exon edge, based on the exon coordinates of the canonical transcript of the gene. NOTE: apart from the requested filtering steps, oligopipe may also exclude some extra variants during the data annotation process . You can consult the complete list of variant exclusion cases during that process here . 2. Gene filtering # The gene filtering option restricts the analysis to a specified list of relevant genes that can be present in your data. This procedure is highly recommended in case your VCF contains the complete exome of an individual, as it can dramatically limit the amount of False Positives that can be obtained. To run your analysis only with a subset of genes, you can simply upload a .txt file with the gene symbols you are interested to include, each gene being in a different line. oligopipe will use this list to filter the genes that will be used in the analysis. NOTE: please make sure that you provide the official approved symbol for each gene (for verification, you can consult the HGNC gene nomenclature page . Data annotation # After you submit your data, oligopipe : automatically annotates them with the biological information needed for the integrated methods creates all possible variant combinations between any pair of genes present in your variant input and orders the variants and genes inside each combination. Below, you can find some important parameters for each process. 1. Gene annotation # To map variants in genes, oligopipe uses at first the gene information that is present in the CADD annotation file for that variant and uses only the canonical transcripts of those genes, according to the Ensembl GRCh37/hg19 or GRCh38/hg38 genome version. In cases where a variant can be mapped to multiple genes , oligopipe maps that variant to only one gene based on a set of priority rules that include (starting from higher to lower priority): valid gene IDs and canonical transcript, prioritisation of genes based on their biotype and the functional consequence of the variant, prioritisation of genes where the variant falls inside the gene and canonical transcript coordinates, presence of a CCDS, prioritisation of gene with the longest canonical transcript, etc. oligopipe then annotates the genes with: the required gene features for VarCoPP (detailed description of the features and their sources in the link) the Residual Variation Intolerance Score (RVIS) , a metric that show the susceptibility of a gene to disease. Lower values of RVIS indicate greater susceptibility of a gene to candidate disease-causing mutations. 2. Gene pair annotation # oligopipe annotates a gene pair with the gene pair features required by VarCoPP (detailed description of the features and their sources in the link). oligopipe uses the Residual Variation Intolerance Score (RVIS) metric to order the appearance of genes inside each digenic variant combination, with gene A being always the gene with the lower RVIS value, and thus more probable to be have a disturbed function due to the presence of a variant. You can find more details about how oligopipe creates digenic variant combinations and orders variants and genes in the Creating digenic variant combinations section. 3. Variant annotation # oligopipe first maps a variant in a gene based on the Gene annotation process described above. It then annotates each variant with the required variant features for VarCoPP , the most important being the CADD score (detailed description of the features and their sources in the link) When oligopipe creates digenic variant combinations, it uses the CADD score to order the appearance of variants that are present inside the same gene (i.e. in cases of heterozygous compound variants). You can find more details about how oligopipe creates digenic variant combinations and orders variants and genes in the Creating digenic variant combinations section. Variant exclusion # In some situations during the data annotation process oligopipe excludes variants from the analysis and you will not find them in the results: Variant not exonic in canonical transcript We use only the canonical Ensembl transcript identifiers to annotate our variants. If you have selected to exclude intronic variants from your analysis, if the variant is not exonic in the canonical transcript of the gene, even if it may be exonic in an alternative transcript, it will be excluded. Variant with invalid zygosity Variants with GT:0/0 or GT:0|0 in a VCF file are considered invalid and are excluded from the analysis. CADD score not available oligopipe annotates variants with a CADD score , which is a feature required for the pathogenicity predictions. As this feature is important for the predictions, if a CADD score is not available for a variant, that variant is excluded for the analysis, as a missing value may severely alter the results. Variants only in one gene As oligopipe creates combinations between gene pairs , if your input data includes variants from one gene only, you will not get any results. The variant is a CNV or medium/long-sized InDel oligopipe analyses only SNVs and small insertions and deletions (up to 100 bp currently). Any other variant type in your data is automatically excluded from the analysis. This is mainly due to the computational resource limitations of our service. Creating digenic variant combinations # After annotation, VarCoPP creates all possible variant combinations between any gene pair present in your input, taking into consideration any filtering options you have included during your variant submission. You can find below a list of details and constraints that take place during this procedure. 1. Number of variants per combination # oligopipe creates for any gene pair variant combinations that can be: bi-allelic (i.e. one mutated allele at each gene) e.g.: one heterozygous variant per gene tri-allelic (i.e. three mutated alleles in total) e.g.: an homozygous variant at gene A and an heterozygous variant in gene B tetra-allelic (i.e. four mutated alleles in total) e.g.: one homozygous variant per gene In the tri-allelic and tetra-allelic cases, a digenic combination can also include heterozygous compound variants (i.e. two different mutated alleles in the same gene), along with the presence of variant(s) in another gene. NOTE: Tetra-allelic variant combinations with heterozygous compound variants in BOTH genes are not created. NOTE: In case where multiple heterozygous variants are present in a single gene, these are used together as heterozygous compound variants in a combination with another gene and not individually anymore. This is to solve the problem of certain genes being over-represented in the results just because they contain heterozygous compound variants. If a single gene contains more than two heterozygous variants, these are used in pairs of two as we always use two mutated alleles per gene. 2. Order of genes # For each digenic variant combination, gene A is always the gene with the lowest Residual Variation Intolerance Score (RVIS) (see also the Gene Annotation section) and, thus, the one with a higher probability to be associated with a disease. 3. Order of variant alleles inside the gene # In case of two different mutated alleles in the same gene (heterozygous compound cases), the variant allele 1 is always the variant allele with the highest CADD score .

If you have selected to exclude intronic variants from your analysis, if the variant is not exonic in the canonical transcript of the gene, even if it may be exonic in an alternative transcript, it will be excluded. Variant with invalid zygosity Variants with GT:0/0 or GT:0|0 in a VCF file are considered invalid and are excluded from the analysis. CADD score not available oligopipe annotates variants with a CADD score , which is a feature required for the pathogenicity predictions. As this feature is important for the predictions, if a CADD score is not available for a variant, that variant is excluded for the analysis, as a missing value may severely alter the results. Variants only in one gene As oligopipe creates combinations between gene pairs , if your input data includes variants from one gene only, you will not get any results. The variant is a CNV or medium/long-sized InDel oligopipe analyses only SNVs and small insertions and deletions (up to 100 bp currently). Any other variant type in your data is automatically excluded from the analysis. This is mainly due to the computational resource limitations of our service.","title":"Variant exclusion"},{"location":"preprocess/#creating-digenic-variant-combinations","text":"After annotation, VarCoPP creates all possible variant combinations between any gene pair present in your input, taking into consideration any filtering options you have included during your variant submission.

NOTE: Tetra-allelic variant combinations with heterozygous compound variants in BOTH genes are not created. NOTE: In case where multiple heterozygous variants are present in a single gene, these are used together as heterozygous compound variants in a combination with another gene and not individually anymore. This is to solve the problem of certain genes being over-represented in the results just because they contain heterozygous compound variants.
